# breast-cancer-identification
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.

In this project, I have explored and leveraged convolutional neural networks to accurately classify if the image contains cancerous cells or not.

The dataset is taken from kaggle
